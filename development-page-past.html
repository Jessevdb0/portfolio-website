                I have always enjoyed to combine creativity and technology, both as young child and later in high-school. In for example high school, I often liked to experiment with coding. Experimenting with python, Unity or Arduino was always a lot of fun for me, even though I never really went in depth before university. But that didnâ€™t keep me from being very interested in it. <br><br>
                Therefore I also had some skills with coding before starting my studies, mainly with the Arduino. With an Arduino I for example made a program where an infra-red sensor detected the input of a remote and controlled a RGB-LED with the given input. Other than that I did not have much prior experience in a design process, and never sketched in my free time for example. <br><br>
