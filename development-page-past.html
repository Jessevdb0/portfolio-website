                I have always enjoyed to combine creativity and technology, as child with Lego or an electronics kit, and later with small projects. In for example high school, I often liked to experiment with coding. Experimenting with python, Unity or Arduino was always a lot of fun for me, even though I never really went in depth before university. But that didnâ€™t keep me from being very interested in it. <br><br>
                Therefore I also had some skills with coding before starting my studies, mainly with the Arduino. Like said, projects with Unity where often short and not in depth. Only with the Arduino I went a little more in depth where I for example made a program where an infra-red sensor detected the input of a remote and controlled a RGB-LED with the given input, where you could set the LEDS brightness and color. <br><br>
