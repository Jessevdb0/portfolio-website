                I have always enjoyed to combine creativity and technology in small projects. In high school, I often for example liked to experiment with coding (if I had a lot of free time). Experimenting with python, Unity or Arduino was always a lot of fun for me, even though I never really went in depth before university. But that didn’t keep me from being very interested in it. <br><br>
                When I started looking for studies in high school I had no idea what to choose. I had such a wide range of subjects which made me both able to go in economic directions as well as technical ones. After some time I discovered industrial design by a father telling about his job at my school. After that day the study has always been one that stayed in the back of my mind, and other (both economic and technical) studies didn’t really make me as enthusiastic as ID. After some time it just felt like it was the perfect study to combine my the wide amount of interests I had in different sectors like technology together with creativity and even economics, which was what made me decide to become an industrial designer.
