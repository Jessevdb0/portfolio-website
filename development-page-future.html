                To develop myself further in the future, I have several short- and long-term goals, to develop in the direction related to my vision and professional identity. <br><br>
                On top of that, there will open space in my next year to choose electives to further direct my own learning. Because developing further in technological (high-fi) prototyping together with electronics or mechanics is important for me to realize my vision of being able to realize my designs, I will look into electives more towards this direction since these are less provided within the core courses from year 2 and on. <br><br>
                In my draft personal development plan I have discussed the goals I have right now and reflected on the goals I had for this quartal, as well as what electives Iâ€™m thinking about choosing in my second year.
