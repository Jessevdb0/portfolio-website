                    I’ve always enjoyed combining technology together with creativity, and therefore also had some experience with it before I went to the Tu/e. As child I was always very interested in making for example a simple all in one robot kit or make moving parts using Lego. Around 1 to 2 years ago I discovered the Arduino which got me very interested. Projects like making a simple game or simply turning on and off a led gave me much joy.<br><br>
                    As designer I aim to combine these interests in technology and creativity with my will to help people and/or solve problems. Therefore, the expertise areas C&A, U&S and T&R are the areas I want to develop in the most as designer, since I believe that most of my passion in designing is related to combining these expertise areas.<br><br>
                    On top of that I get a lot of fulfilment from making an idea reality with the use of technology. Seeing your own idea come to real life and solving the challenges that come with it is what I love to do and which also drives me as designer. 
                    I am really motivated to perform the best I can, which also makes me enthusiastic to  learn both in university and by myself. Especially when I start making my idea reality I don’t mind learning and trying multiple times to achieve what I want. I aim to combine these qualities to design products/projects which I’m proud of.<br><br>
                    However, my passion of realizing an idea also has its disadvantages, since I start thinking about how to realize an idea once I get enthusiastic about it. This makes me get into tunnel vision quite fast which limits me in exploring alternatives and being creative. Getting conscious about this pitfall made me realize when I get into tunnel vision, so I can avoid it. On top of that, my will to perform good makes me find it difficult to let go of tasks in a team that aren’t my responsibility, mainly because then I don’t have influence anymore on what will be done and in what quality. This often makes me take for example more responsibility than necessary.<br><br>

                    I believe that design will be equally as not more important in the (near) future as it is right now. AI is getting larger and influences us more and more, and AI is already taking over certain tasks we did as human before. However, I don’t believe AI will ever be as good as a designer as humans can be, I believe we have qualities in creativity and originality that AI can’t achieve, which makes design really important, also because we need to design ways to deal with AI. <br><br>
                    I as designer want to create products to make peoples life enjoyable by creating new experiences, or make older experiences more enjoyable. I believe that we are heading towards a future where there will be a lot of automation together with AI (exaggerated vision in figure with Wall-E), however, I don’t believe this is what we as humanity want in the end. Therefore I want to design for a future where we use devices for an enhanced experience (and have full influence on what they do and collect) and not let devices automate/remove this experience for us. <br><br>
