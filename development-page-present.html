                        For me, creativity and aesthetics is all about exploring and ideating. About using techniques to come up with as many ideas as possible and iterate on top of these ideas. It is about keeping an open mind and thinking outside of the box. About the process of making non-physical ideas a concept by sketching, prototyping and over all visualization, as well as using these techniques to communicate the idea. <br> <br>
                        I learned multiple ideation methods through project 1 lectures, and got more familiar with them by implementing them in my project as well as by getting feedback by my coaches. Learning about and improving in these methods like brainstorming, affinity diagramming and exploratory sketching made me more competent as a designer in an ideation process. <br> <br>
                        Lectures from project 1, Human-Centered design and self-study on for example SolidWorks improved and developed my prototyping skills. Techniques like wizard of oz, quick Low-Fi prototyping with cardboard and foam and 3d-printing made me more competent in prototyping both quick and Low-Fi as well as more detailed Mid to High-Fi. In project 1 I also implemented video prototyping multiple times to be able to communicate functionalities that didnâ€™t work in real life. This was important for me since I believe this is a good way of receiving feedback before actually realizing the concept, especially for more complicated designs. <br> <br> 
                        In general I believe prototyping is extremely important for both iterating and communicating your concept. On top of that I also noticed I get a lot of ideas and get really active during prototyping and therefore aim to implement prototyping throughout the whole design process as designer.

                        For me, the expertise area User and Society is about designing for your users and thereby involving users in your design process. It is about thinking what user experience you want to bring with your design. Therefore it is also about evaluating your design together with users and stakeholders or with them in your mind. Lastly it is also about thinking about the societal impact of your design and what you want this impact to be. <br><br>  
                        I believe designing user-centered is important since I am designing the product for them. For me this means that they should have a role in the design process. Applying techniques learned in Human-centered Design in project 1 like using fictional personas helped me design user-centered by having an example of a possible user. However, since I didnâ€™t implement much techniques at the start of the project, I made sure to focus on designing user-centered from the beginning in project 2, which was also a goal I set for myself. A new way of brainstorming around possible target groups and applying personas early on in the process helped me design user-centered from the start. <br><br>
                        Implementing prototyping techniques in both project 1 and 2 also taught me how you can use prototyping to communicate and test the desired user experience you want to bring with your product. Through user-testing I learned how to use these prototypes to gain feedback and get new insights from your users. I aim to continue using and expanding my techniques for implementing users throughout the whole design process.

                        For me, technology and realization is all about applying technology and (higher-fi) prototyping techniques to make (partly) working prototypes to gain feedback and communicate the concept more clearly. But also to be able to create a prototype that is (close to) the final version of your design, or in other words it is about being able to create your vision of the design you had in real life (to a certain extent) <br><br>
                        I have been developing myself in this expertise area in the first semester by myself. By having simple personal projects I got more skilled in using Arduinoâ€™s and components. In project 1 I also experimented with using technology for prototypes, for example, I researched how to use a joystick sensor and how to connect it with Unity. These projects made me more competent in coding for prototyping purposes. On top of that I taught myself the basics of SolidWorks by following online tutorials to be able to make a more detailed, 3d-printed, final prototype. <br><br>
                        During the third quartal I generally got more competent in understanding technology. Implementing new components like transistors during sessions of creative electronics made me really understand how certain components work instead of copy pasting code from the internet. Implementing mechanical concepts in for example building a paper bridge and disassembling existing devices during sessions of CME taught me more about how actually use theoretical (physics) concepts in real life. <br><br>
                        Learning all these realization techniques and learning how to implement them in real life, is important for me as a designer because I believe all those techniques are essential to be able to make detailed working prototypes including technology in the future, which is necessary to realize my will of being able to realize my designs (to a certain extent).

                        For me, math data and computing is about being able to handle, process and analyze data. For example data gathered from surveys, questionnaires or interviews, but also data collected by your designed product. Therefore it is also about how to design a product to effectively store and use data to for example adapt to its user. However, it is also about how data communication between devices works, and how to safely handle data. <br><br>
                        The course foundation of data analytics taught me how to retrieve data from databases using SQL, how to visualize and analyze data, but also how to read and interpret different idioms like histograms and kernel density plots. Through practical exercises and assignments I have learned to implement these techniques with data, and create visuals for both interpretation of data and communication of results. <br><br>
                        In project 2 I implemented a basic ESP-NOW protocol to experiment with sending data wirelessly from one ESP to another. On top of that, challenge 2 from Creative Programming and a small prototype from project 1 taught me how to use serial communication to communicate data wired, from an arduino to the computer. These projects taught me the basics of data communication, and how to use the communicated data. In the next stages I aim to continue experimenting with ESPâ€™s to implement wireless communication in the final prototype.

                        For me, business and entrepreneurship is about thinking about the business related topics around your design. Can your product even be profitable? What costs come into place when producing your design? But I believe it is also about thinking about how to sell your design, therefore it is also about pitching and presenting your ideas/designs. <br><br>
                        During my first 3 quartiles of my study I havenâ€™t learned or implemented much techniques or theory in the business and entrepreneurship expertise area. However, I do believe it is important to learn these economical topics like designing profitable and marketing your product to be able to for example have conversations with businesses or sell your design. Therefore I aim at learning and implementing more techniques for B&E in my projects in my second year.

                            As designer I have improved and developed several professional skills this academic year. To start I believe I have improved the most in reflecting in action, on action and after action. Reflecting has always been sort of a natural thing for me, however not in an effective way as designer. By practicing with reflections for PI&V and a personal goal I set for myself, I have improved in using reflections effectively by evaluating why something is important to me, realizing what I learned from something and how to redirect my future learning and set goals based on the learning activity. However, now I understand the effective â€˜reflection formatâ€™ for me as a designer, I aim to make writing these reflections more natural by continuing with practicing, since it now takes a lot of effort and time to make sure Iâ€™m reflecting in the right way. <br><br>
                            As designer I have also improved in using these reflections to set goals and self-direct my learning. In project 1 I mainly let everything overwhelm me and didnâ€™t really have predefined goals (because it was my first project), however I realized that you learn way more effectively in projects if you go into the project with certain goals. Therefore I have started using (SMART-) goals way more naturally since project 1 by reflecting on previous activities or receiving feedback, but also by realizing what I want to get more competent in as designer based on my professional identity and vision. <br>

                            Also my skills in working within a team have been improved in several ways. First, I have improved in communicating within a team and thereby also giving and receiving constructive feedback by or to a group member. In project 1 I received as feedback that I sometimes talk a lot when I get enthusiastic which leaves less space for others to have their input. By setting a goal for myself I have improved on getting conscious on whether Iâ€™m limiting the input of the team by talking too much myself. On top of that, I have improved in dividing tasks, and thereby also letting go of certain tasks within a project. However, especially letting go of tasks has been hard for me and is something Iâ€™m actively working on to improve further.

                            In project 1, the reflective transformative design process first got introduced. As designer this was my first time really undergoing a design process. This RTD-process helped me guide myself in what next steps I should take in the design process, like validating after envisioning, which is important for me to make sure Iâ€™m â€˜ticking all the boxesâ€™ in a design process and not for example base my project on assumptions because I forgot to do research. <br><br>
                            On top of that, the course information literacy made me more competent in researching by learning techniques about effective search plans, how to use queries and how to operate on databases. Implementing these techniques makes me able to do more effective research which is important for me as designer in all projects to validate assumptions, look into existing problem, get information on your design subject and much more.

Therefore the project is more focused on learning to make a working prototype of your concept, which I find really important to be able to do as designer, and therefore I believe this project is really important for my personal development. <br><br>In this project we are designing a companion relieving stress and anxienty by its user by providing comfort and help with calming down breathing through a breathing motion. The companion has a 'fidget toy' as heart which you can take with you if you leave home, so that you can get comfort also when you're gone from home</p>

Since I have never really used HTML or CSS before, this portfolio is my first actual project using and applying learned techniques. Coding my portfolio was important for me since I want to become competent in coding for prototyping as a designer, and this was a great opportunity to explore and learn the basics of HTML and CSS. </p>
