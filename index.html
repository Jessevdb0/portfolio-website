                    I’ve always been interested in combining technology together with creativity, even as a young child playing with Lego or an all in one electronic kits. As designer I aim to combine these interests in technology and creativity with my will to help people and/or solve problems. Next to these interests, I realized that I get a lot of fulfilment from making an idea reality with the use of technology. Seeing your own idea come to real life and especially solving the challenges that come with it is what I love to do and which also drives me as designer. Therefore, as designer I aim to specialize and develop in both rapid and high-fidelity prototyping together with technology like electronics to make your ideas reality (T&R), but also in including users in the design process to design products specialized for the intended user (U&S) and in ideating and brainstorming (C&A). <br><br>
                    I am really motivated to perform the best I can, which also makes me enthusiastic to  learn both in university and by myself. This means I also don’t mind to learn a lot to achieve what I want, especially when I start prototyping to make my idea reality. To get all my work done I like to stay organized by having a clear overview of what needs to get done. <br><br>
                    However, my passion of realizing an idea also has its disadvantages, since I start thinking about how to realize an idea once I get enthusiastic about it. This makes focus on only 1 idea, which limits me in exploring alternatives and being creative. However, I believe ideating in a team is important to get different visions and ideas from everyone, but also because this can help me realize when I’m too focused on an idea. On top of that, my will to perform good makes me find it difficult to let go of tasks in a team that aren’t my responsibility (since this results in having less influence on how the task will get done).

                        I believe that design will be equally as not more important in the (near) future as it is right now. AI is getting larger and larger by already taking over tasks we did as human before. However, I don’t believe AI will ever be as good as a designer as humans can be, because of our qualities in originality and creativity. Therefore design will be very important, but also because we need to design ways to handle and use AI in our world. <br><br>

                        As designer I want to create products to make peoples life enjoyable by solving problems, creating new experiences, or making older experiences more enjoyable. With the rapid development in AI, I believe we will be surrounded by automated products and services in the future. When thinking about such a future, I imagine these doom-scenarios where humans don’t have an active role in the world anymore (exaggerated vision in figure with Wall-e). However, I don’t believe this is what we as humanity want in the end and therefore I aim to design against this future. Therefore I want to design for a future where we use (daily life) products for enhanced experiences and not let devices remove a valuable experience for us. <br><br>
                        However, I have realized that there is a thin line between enhancing user experience and automating an experience. When a product automates a simple (maybe not so valuable) daily task, is it then automation to enhance an experience? Where is the line of automation making someone’s life easier and more interesting, without making someone’s life boring? As designer I want to explore where I believe this line is with my designs.
